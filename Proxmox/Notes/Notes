agent permission being disabled/frozen and unable to run the qm guess exec commands even though the qm agent is installed and was running. 
This forum post tells us its to do with the blacklist file and to comment out the 
guess-exec etc to allow commands to run.

This next bookmark was the only forum post which had something to us than the usual test
if qm agent is installed properly etc. 

By altering the permission on the OS in the VM itself from "enforicing" to "Permissive" 

Commands: (in the VM) 

sestatus (check output)
sudo setenforce 0 (this changes the enforcing to permissive)

forgot to add the link: 

Here's another useful one instead

https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Qemu-guest-agent#:~:text=The%20qemu%2Dguest%2Dagent%20is,execute%20command%20in%20the%20guest.

Next step: 

everything works, but for some reason when running the script I am getting permission denied on the qm guess exec commands. 
Want to turn on/connect to the network interface in the clone. The hurdle is the denial, Callum said the agent is it's own thing and
probably need to elevate that specific account to run  the commands. 

at the moment I am learning I can run the commands within the VM to turn on the interface, the VM will be using. It's just getting 
the top right in the drop down menu: 

Red Hat Ethernet Off
Intel Ethernet Off
User1 

to turn intel Ethernet on/connect. Then figure out how  to manually set the ip address.
